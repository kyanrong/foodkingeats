Had to rework the database schema a few times.
Cases:
- Visits to places overseas (needed to add currency)
-> Added currrency column
- Addresses in other countries are of different format 
- Visits to same places (affects dateOfUpload, rating, isSponsored, youtubeUrl)
-> Added new table Visits and added VisitId column in Food table
- Prices of different formats (some only provided minimum prices, some had a price range, some had additional info like $x for one slice)
-> Added minPrice, maxPrice, hasPriceRange
